# Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive Excel file to track and analyze the usage of endoscopes in the institute I work for. 
Endoscopes are the essential tools, allowing for minimally invasive procedures and detailed internal examinations. By systematically recording and analyzing data on endoscope usage, we aim to improve operational efficiency, ensure optimal utilization of resources, and enhance patient care.

This Excel file incorporates various advanced features and functions, including  IFERROR, dynamic arrays, drop-down lists, dynamic tables, and visual charts. These tools enable us to manage data effectively, minimize errors, and present insights in a clear and accessible manner.
